I\u0026rsquo;m really amazed by it since it packs both Bluetooth and WiFi in a small yet powerful unit. Since I received the MCU rather than the module, so, to use it, I made myself a breakout board named ESPer(because, why not? 😄). Feel free to check out its Instructable over here.\nSo, coming back on track, this post is dedicated on how to use it efficiently via Mongoose OS, which in my opinion, is a great firmware to start with for ESP32 beginners, such as me. It provides a good interface for creating, modifying and and uploading code. I think it\u0026rsquo;s biggest feature is that it allows code modification over the air(OTA) so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to flash your device for every small modification.\nSpeaking of code, it also supports a variety of languages, including C++, JavaScript and guess what, Wiring(Arduino). I think that\u0026rsquo;s enough of decribing what Mongoose OS is.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re more curious about Mongoose OS, check out it\u0026rsquo;s official site: Mongoose OS.\n Prepping and Beginning! To flash your ESPer with Mongoose OS, you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to have the following things at bay:\n ESPer or ESP32 MCU.   This method will also work if your ESP32 is wired according to the ESPer schematic here. The ESP32 chip I used!\n  Arduino(any model) or a USB to TTL Converter 5 - Jumper Wires 2 - Breadboards (since ESPer doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit on one)  That\u0026rsquo;s all for the requirements. Once you\u0026rsquo;re sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got all the stuff, boost ahead!\n Installing the mos Tool The Mongoose OS website provides an easy-to-use tool for flashing and managing Mongoose OS on devices. This tool also aids in uploading code and in numerous other tasks.\nThe installation instructions have been documented on the official website here. Since I\u0026rsquo;m using Lubuntu myself, I had to use the following commands:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mongoose-os/mos $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install mos   Wiring up ESPer Once the tool is downloaded, wire up your ESPer with any USB to TTL Converter since the flashing is to be done via UART.\nTo keep things applicable to a larger reader-base, I\u0026rsquo;ll be proceeding with my good \u0026lsquo;ol Arduino UNO. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to use an Arduino as a USB to TTL Converter since it has an in-built CH340G Converter which the Arduino uses for programming the ATmega IC. Now wire up ESPer according to the wiring diagram posted above. Once done it should look something like this.\n Be careful while making the power connections because ESP32 MCU is not 5V tolerable therefore you might end up burning your MCU if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful.\n Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, connect your Arduino to your PC or any other device.\n Flashing the Firmware Now that everything\u0026rsquo;s done, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is to flash the firmware onto the ESPer board. To do that:\n Launch the mos tool. In my case, that is Linux, it is opened by entering mos in the terminal. This will open up the mos Web UI in your web browser.  In the UI, set the Arduino Serial Port, device as esp32 and an app of your choice. Then click on Flash.  After a few moments, the UI will attempt to connect to the device. In this interval, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to get off from your keyboard to the ESPer board. To connect the device to the UI, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to make it enter Download Mode. This is done by pressing and holding the Boot button, and then the Reset button. After a second, release the Reset button first and then the Boot button. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that the UI will have begun the flashing process by then. Once the message \u0026ldquo;All done\u0026rdquo; pops up in the console. Close the web browser and terminate the mos command by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.  This concludes the flashing process.\n Configuring the WiFi Settings So we have flashed the Mongoose OS firmware in our ESPer board now, but we still haven\u0026rsquo;t configured the WiFi Settings which is the most important feature of IoT devices since they have to be connected to the internet. To configure WiFi:\n Press the Reset button on the ESPer board. Wait for a minute or so to let the MCU boot up. Launch the mos tool again and select your Arduino Serial Port. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the UI automatically detects that the Mongoose OS firmware is installed on the device and asks you to enter the WiFi settings. Enter the WiFi settings and that\u0026rsquo;s it.   The Sky\u0026rsquo;s the Limit Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve installed an OS on your ESPer board or ESP32, you can do almost anything with it, be it a mini Arduino or a WiFi server, you name it. So go ahead and start coding and making. The video below shows my ESPer flashed with the Blink Code.\n   The video was recorded before this post was published that is why there is no silkscreen on the ESPer board.\n So that\u0026rsquo;s how you install Mongoose OS on your ESPer board. You may refer to the official documentation to get acquainted with the UI and use it effectively in your projects. This is the link: Mongoose OS Documentation\nIf you feel that I missed something, please use the Disqus Comments below to let me know. Same goes for the improvement suggestions.\nA huge thanks to  DFRobot for sending me awesome stuff.\nThanks for reading! 😀\nKeep Making!\n","date":1517146183,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517146183,"objectID":"0ae86ca65f5ff01254d97496abacc75f","permalink":"/post/mos/","publishdate":"2018-01-28T18:59:43+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/mos/","section":"post","summary":"Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve got my hands on the craved-for IoT ESP32, thanks to  DFRobot, and have been tinkering with it ever since.

Furthermore, I\u0026rsquo;m also supposed to share the challenges I faced during the set-up process as a sort of feedback. I\u0026rsquo;ll be trying be concise in this post so, without further ado, I\u0026rsquo;m beginning with this post.\nInstalling \u0026ldquo;django-netjsonconfig\u0026rdquo; The installation instructions for this this module have been well-documented on its GitHub repository. So I began the installation by creating a Python 2.7 Virtual Environment using python2 -m virtualenv py2 for the sake of cleanliness on my local machine. I chose python2 for since for this since I was also on the lookout for bugs in the module and most of the bugs seem to be related with it since it\u0026rsquo;s a bit outdated now.\nI then activated the virtualenv and started entering the installation commands according to the instructions in the repository. Everything went on smoothly until the python setup.py develop command. I got an error as shown in the below picture.\nClearly, the error suggests that Django v2.0.1 was being downloaded which isn\u0026rsquo;t supported by Python 2.7. A bit of browsing led me to the conclusion that the setup.py needed to be modified to download older Django versions for Python 2.7. So, I added a simple if-else block to the django installation statement as shown in the picture.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about my fix, this is the link.\nHere, what\u0026rsquo;s being done is basically:\n Detect python version used for installation using sys.version_info[0]. Install older Django versions if sys.version_info[0]\u0026lt;3, that is python2 is detected. Install latest version if above condition isn\u0026rsquo;t satisfied, that is python3 is detected.  I also had to remove the django installation line from requirements.txt since setup.py was fetching the requirement names from there. After applying this fix, I re-ran the python setup.py develop command and there it was! The sweet smell of success. Now an older yet python2 compatible version of Django was being installed when using python2 as clearly shown in one of the pictures below:\nAfter this, I installed some more requirements using pip install -r requirements-test.txt This was how I\u0026rsquo;d finished installing django-netjsonconfig using Python2. Now all that was left to do was to to do the migrations and run the server.\nMaking Migrations and Creating a superuser By referring to the instructions on the repo again, I opened the tests directory, did the migrations using ./manage.py migrate. It was really satisfying to see all the CLI responses coloured in green. 😄 After that, there was the superuser creation using ./manage.py createsuperuser.\nRunning the Test Server I started the test server using ./manage.py runserver and it was successful.\nI could also now visit the server at http://localhost:8000/admin.\nConclusion So, that\u0026rsquo;s how I installed the django-netjsonconfig module. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve commited my fixes to my forked repo here. Here\u0026rsquo;s the link to my pull request.

This post is for sharing my experiences with GCI, as the title suggests. So let\u0026rsquo;s just get on it.\nIt all began while I was returning from an outing on 5 December, 2017 and was searching the internet for Google Science Fair to check if I could participate in it or not. When I searched it and scrolled down, I saw a link for Google Code-in. The very combination of the words Google and Code had raised my adrenaline levels and so I starting reading about it and after a few moments, I had decided to participate in it. Soon I had my father fill up the Parental Consent and I was ready to begin.\nBeing a total beginner with this contest and with the concepts of FOSS, I had a lot to learn, and I was aware of that. So after a few days of jumping from one organization to the other, I was finally able to settle at OpenWISP. This was thankfully possible due to my chat on their Gitter room with one of their mentors. It also gave me the confidence to proceed ahead with my skill-set and so I began doing the tasks provided by this organisation.\n The Things I\u0026rsquo;ve Learnt: Being a participant of GCI, I have learned a lot of things.Here are the few of the many things which I\u0026rsquo;ve learn\u0026rsquo;t till date, thanks to OpenWISP(I\u0026rsquo;m still learning more 😉):\n1. Linux Command Line Ever since the beginning of GCI, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Lubuntu for doing almost everything. Be it installing packages, setting up a virtual machine, creating a webpage, using GitHub or hosting a local server, I\u0026rsquo;ve got so used to the quick and efficient CLI of Linux now that I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a sort of disgust for using the mouse. I\u0026rsquo;ve also acquired great details about popularly used shell commands.\n2. git and GitHub GitHub is the basic need of any developer/maker who intends to share his/her work online. I\u0026rsquo;m also very fond of the working of GitHub. It allows easy sharing, modifications and contributions to projects through the usage of clones and pull requests . Since OpenWISP is also on GitHub(which open-source organisation isn\u0026rsquo;t nowadays? 😄), there have been a lot of tasks involving GitHub. Doing those tasks has increased my knowledge tenfold and I\u0026rsquo;m now very comfortable with using git.\n3. Virtual Machines There are some times when a software isn\u0026rsquo;t compatible with the OS you\u0026rsquo;ve installed. In that case, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to use virtual machines or VMs rather than installing a whole new OS. I already had a bit of experiences with VMs but I never went deep. While doing some tasks, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a few handy things to perform with VMs such as configuring the network settings, passing commands remotely using SSH and using them as disposable local webservers.\n4. Python I had been thinking about learning Python since it\u0026rsquo;s getting more and more popular nowadays, but I could never get rid of my hesitation that \u0026ldquo;Python a whole new language\u0026rdquo; since I only had exposure to Java. But the tasks that OpenWISP provided in Google Code-in rid me of this hesitation of mine. Once I began reading about it, I found out how similar it is to Java and have therefore started practising it now and hope that I might be able to master it someday. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt how to install python modules, how to interpret error messages, and using virtualenv for isolated working area.\n5. Web Programming Just like Python, I had the same hesitation with web programming as well. But one task in GCI removed this hesitation. That specific task required me to create my own website using Django and guess what, python! As much as I remember it took me two whole days to understand what I had to do and then I created it. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious about that site of mine, here\u0026rsquo;s the link to it. I also can\u0026rsquo;t proceed without referencing to the tutorial OpenWISP referred to me since the authors( DjangoGirls) have done a great job. Here\u0026rsquo;s the link!\n6. CSS \u0026amp; HTML The same tutorial which taught Django also introduced me to the concepts of CSS. After having learn\u0026rsquo;t a bit of CSS, I wanted to test it out. A task in GCI required me to review a pull request of another fellow GCI student. I thought of it as an opportunity and here\u0026rsquo;s the results of my CSS \u0026amp; HTML coding. I helped @BrainBuzzer in creating this website by adding some HTML pages and some other stuff. They are stated here. By the way, the website was supposed to be a thanks to OpenWISP and mostly its mentors for their guidance.\n7. Creating Properly Formatted Python and YAML Script Files A few of my tasks required me to use python and YAML scripts. Since my PC is a bit outdated and it can\u0026rsquo;t run high-end editing softwares such as Atom smoothly, I was stuck with Lubuntu\u0026rsquo;s in-built text editor Leafpad. Initially it was a bit hard for me to format my scripts properly but after a few tries, I seem to have learnt it.\n8. Markdown GitHub uses this markup language for text formatting. Since it is used almost everywhere, from Gitter to Comments in GitHub and even in GitHub Pages, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take me long to get acquainted with it. FYI, this post is also written using Markdown on Dillinger. The picture above shows a code snippet of Markdown.\n9. Creating RESTful APIs with Python \u0026amp; Django There was also a task in GCI for completion of which, I had to create a RESTful API for my local server. Finishing this task was a bit herculean since the tutorial I referred to was outdated but thanks my previous exposure to Django and Python, I was able to debug the errors and finish this task within the given time-frame. The picture below shows a RESTful API.\n10. Creating A Website Thanks to all the things I learnt during GCI, I have now created a blog for myself and the blog I\u0026rsquo;ve created is the one you\u0026rsquo;re currently reading 😄. This website is hosted through GitHub Pages and the posts are written using Markdown. I\u0026rsquo;ve also used Travis to constantly detect my pushes, build them and push the build to the master branch of the website repository.\n The Challenges I Faced: While doing the Google Code-in tasks, I didn\u0026rsquo;t face any huge challenges as such. But still challenges are challenges and these are the ones I faced:\n1. ansible-openwisp2 In one of my tasks, I had to debug the ansible-openwisp2. The issue seemed to be caused by a python library (spatialite) on specific systems (operating systems). The repo worked on newer operating systems such as Ubuntu 16.04 but failed on the older ones. Since I was very desperate to fix this bug, I had spent hours doing the testing but to no end. Lastly, a very basic fix removed the issue, and that fix was updating ansible to the latest version.\n2. Creating a RESTful API using Python and Django This task was a bit time consuming due to the outdated tutorial I referred to for learning RESTful API creation. As much as I remember, I had to do several modifications of mine to get the API to work, the major ones of them being:\n Downgrading to good \u0026lsquo;ol Django version 1.10. Installing the rest-framework-swagger v0.3.10 django module. Installing the django-rest-framework v0.1.0 django module. Adding fields='__all__' to the Serializers.  You might think as to why I did the downgrading, which is a correct point. I did so because the skeleton django project which I was using was configured according to the older django and django evolves pretty fast, trust me.\n3. Vagrant Vagrant is a tool which allows the easy creation of VMs and also the installation of huge projects just by running a single file named Vagrantfile. As I\u0026rsquo;ve stated earlier, I have a really outdated PC. Vagrant requires VTI -x which my PC didn\u0026rsquo;t have. This fact really set me back big-time. Luckily I was able to do one Vagrant task using my college-returned brother\u0026rsquo;s laptop, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to do any other Vagrant tasks afterwards since he had returned to his college. I also tried searching for a way to use Vagrant without this feature but had no success. That\u0026rsquo;s why I had to leave a few Vagrant tasks. I also wanted to contribute to a repository by creating a Vagrantfile for it, but I was unable to do so since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to run Vagrant.\n Aspects I didn\u0026rsquo;t Like: There aren\u0026rsquo;t really any aspects about GCI or OpenWISP that I don\u0026rsquo;t like. However I do have a few suggestions for OpenWISP:\n1. Scarcity of Mentors I feel that there\u0026rsquo;s a scarcity of mentors in OpenWISP, and it\u0026rsquo;s a huge setback. It causes task reviewing delays. This is also very burdening for the mentors who have the responsibility of reviewing the tasks\n2. Activity Time Slots of Mentors This suggestion actually supplements the above one in a way. Since most of the mentors belong to the same continent, therefore they are active only during one part of the day. This causes issues for someone in an incompatible time zone since he/she has to break his/her daily routine to reach the mentors.\n3. Not all Mentors appear on Gitter I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that not all mentors appear on Gitter to answer the queries of the participants, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a good sign. So increasing mentor participations in the discussion platforms(such as Gitter) would be a good start.\n Ending Note Phew, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think that my write-up would be this huge, looks like I still have a long way to go as a writer. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I\u0026rsquo;m really, whole-heartedly thankful to Google Code-in as well as OpenWISP for increasing my skill-set significantly. I never would\u0026rsquo;ve thought that I\u0026rsquo;d be able to learn python, host my own website and all the stuff which I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt in these challenging yet fun forty days. I really appreciate the guidance OpenWISP provided since I was a mere beginner at everything when I had planned to enter Google Code-in, but now I\u0026rsquo;ve leveled up 😄. I\u0026rsquo;ve also made some great friends along the way with whom I love discussing programming-related stuff. I really hope that one day I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to improve my skills to that extent at which I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to contribute to OpenWISP as a mentor.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all that I have to to say. Actually, no 😉 ! I\u0026rsquo;d like to share a quote before that:\n Everything seems difficult until and unless you give it a try.\n ","date":1515819563,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515819563,"objectID":"abbb7076a2f6a1db6a73e379db4d649a","permalink":"/post/gci/","publishdate":"2018-01-13T10:29:23+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/gci/","section":"post","summary":"Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been participating in Google Code-in which is Google\u0026rsquo;s initiative to introduce young minds to the concept of FOSS, that is Free or Open-Source Softwares.
