I am a geek who likes programming, teaching and learning stuff. The intriguing urge to learn had been developing in me since long back, After getting out of highschool, I now have time to learn various new stuff. The saying knowledge increases by spreading means a lot to me and thus the teaching part. I am still new at it but i think i am getitng a great hang of it!  
Happy Learning!!!
